# todoz-nodejs
todoz is an array of projects, where I will be trying to build simple todo app in different technologies. the main focus of these projects to show case my coding style, folder structure and unit testing.

In this NodeJs version of todoz, I will be writing a simple backend in KoaJs + Knex + Jest and will make sure to follow Test Driven Development strictly.
